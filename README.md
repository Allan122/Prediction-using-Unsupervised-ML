This project explores the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques for pattern discovery and data segmentation. The primary focus is on clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings within the data without prior labels. Key techniques utilized in this project include K-Means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Objectives
- Implement and compare various unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Analyze and interpret the resulting clusters.
- Visualize the clustering outcomes to provide intuitive insights into the data structure.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
